Results:\n\u2717 Create a Python script to generate a PDF article about AI agents in 2025: The pip install command failed (\"pip: command not found\"), so reportlab is not installed. The Python script file was created, but without the required library, it cannot generate a PDF. The task objective to generate a PDF article was not achieved.\n\u2713 Write the script to a file named 'generate_pdf.py': Task completed (max iterations reached)\n\u2717 Install required dependencies (reportlab): The task objective was to install the required dependency \"reportlab,\" but the actual result only shows checking the Python version. No installation command was executed, and there is no evidence that reportlab was installed.\n\u2717 Execute the script to generate the PDF: No PDF files were created or modified, and the terminal output indicates a pip command error, which may have hindered script execution. Despite \"Error: None\" in the output, the lack of generated PDF suggests the task objective was not achieved.\n\u2717 Verify the generated PDF file exists and check its content: The PDF file exists, but the content verification was not completed. The terminal command only checked for the presence of `pdftotext` and did not actually extract or display the PDF's content."
